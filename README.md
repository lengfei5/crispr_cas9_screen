# CRISPR-Cas9 screening data analysis with mageck 

### Two processing pipelines which can quantify the read count table from raw data (before demultiplexing bam files)

#### CRISPR-UMI from Georg in IMBA

#### from Jesse in Zuber group 
some notes for this nf process pipeline:
- library id should be unique (doulbe check)
- library file: second column should be names 'group'
- barcode file: first column should be the corresponding input files (bam or fastq)
